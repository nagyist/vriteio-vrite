## Configuration

The Dev.to extension has a few options you have to configure to activate it.

### API Key

To retrieve your Dev.to API key, go to the bottom of the _Extensions_ section in the DEV _Settings_: [https://dev.to/settings/extensions](https://dev.to/settings/extensions)

Here, add a description and _Generate API Key_.

### Organization ID (optional)

If you want to publish the posts as an organization, you have to provide your _Organization ID_.

You can find it by going to your DEV dashboard ([https://dev.to/dashboard](https://dev.to/dashboard)) then switching from _Personal_ to your organization view using the selection menu above the posts list and copying the organization ID from the URL:

```
https://dev.to/dashboard/organization/[ID]
```

### Content Group ID

The content group you want to automatically publish from. Once a content piece is moved directly to this content group, it’ll trigger a Webhook that’ll auto-publish the content piece on Dev.to.

You can copy the content group ID from the content group menu in either the dashboard or the explorer.

### Require Canonical Link

When checked, the auto-publishing won’t trigger if the content piece doesn’t have a **canonical link** assigned. Useful when cross-posting the content to e.g. Dev.to and your own blog.

### Auto-publish

Whether to enable auto-publishing for all content pieces by default.

### Draft

Whether the Dev.to article should be marked as a draft on the platform (not publically visible).

## Usage

With auto-publish enabled, once ready, simply move the content piece from e.g. _Drafts_ content group to the one configured e.g. _Published_. You should see the article published on Dev.to shortly after.

The extension also provides a content piece view (available from the _Extensions_ section of the _Content piece_ side panel.

From here, you can customize the _Auto-publish_ and _Draft_ per the given content piece, and also set a _Series name_ to associate the article with, once it’s published on DEV.

Finally, with or without the auto-publishing enabled, you can easily publish “manually” using the _Publish_ button.
