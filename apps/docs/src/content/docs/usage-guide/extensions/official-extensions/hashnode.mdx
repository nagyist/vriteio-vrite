## Configuration

The Hashnode extension has a few options you have to configure to activate it.

### Access Token

To retrieve your Hashnode Personal Access Token, go to the Developer Settings section of your Hashnode account ([https://hashnode.com/settings/developer](https://hashnode.com/settings/developer)) and click _Generate new token_.

### Publication ID

You can find it by going to your Hashnode **Blog Dashboard** and copying the publication ID from the URL:

```
https://hashnode.com/[ID]/dashboard
```

### Content Group ID

The content group you want to automatically publish from. Once a content piece is moved directly to this content group, it’ll trigger a Webhook that’ll auto-publish the content piece on Hashnode.

You can copy the content group ID from the content group menu in either the dashboard or the explorer.

### Require Canonical Link

When checked, the auto-publishing won’t trigger if the content piece doesn’t have a **canonical link** assigned. Useful when cross-posting the content to e.g. Hashnode and your own blog.

### Auto-publish

Whether to enable auto-publishing for all content pieces by default.

## Usage

With auto-publish enabled, once ready, simply move the content piece from e.g. _Drafts_ content group to the one configured e.g. _Published_. You should see the article published on Hashnode shortly after.

The extension also provides a content piece view (available from the _Extensions_ section of the _Content piece_ side panel.

From here, you can customize the _Auto-publish_ option per the given content piece, and easily publish the article “manually” using the _Publish_ button.
