## Configuration

The Medium extension has a few options you have to configure to activate it.

### Integration Token

To retrieve your Medium Integration Token, go to the _Security and apps_ section of your Medium account’s _Settings_: [https://medium.com/me/settings/security](https://medium.com/me/settings/security)

From here, at the bottom of the section, click _Integration tokens_. In the modal, provide a description for your token and click _Get token_.

### Content Group ID

The content group you want to automatically publish from. Once a content piece is moved directly to this content group, it’ll trigger a Webhook that’ll auto-publish the content piece on Medium.

You can copy the content group ID from the content group menu in either the dashboard or the explorer.

### Require Canonical Link

When checked, the auto-publishing won’t trigger if the content piece doesn’t have a **canonical link** assigned. Useful when cross-posting the content to e.g. Medium and your own blog.

### Auto-publish

Whether to enable auto-publishing for all content pieces by default.

### Draft

Whether the Medium article should have a _draft_ status on the platform (not publically visible).

## Usage

With auto-publish enabled, once ready, simply move the content piece from e.g. _Drafts_ content group to the one configured e.g. _Published_. You should see the article published on Medium shortly after.

The extension also provides a content piece view (available from the _Extensions_ section of the _Content piece_ side panel.

From here, you can customize the _Auto-publish_ and _Draft_ options per the given content piece, and easily publish the article “manually” using the _Publish_ button.
